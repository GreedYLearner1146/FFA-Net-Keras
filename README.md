# FFA-Net-Keras

This is the code repository for my best attempt in coding the FFA-Net dehazing architecture (Qin et al.: "FFA-Net: Feature Fusion Attention Network for Single Image Dehazing") in keras, as so far there are no code repository dedicated to this. The architecture of the FFA-Net is illustrated below and is straight from the paper.
